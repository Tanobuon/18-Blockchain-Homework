### About the application
The app is built on python using libraries such as : Pandas, Datetime, Hashlib and runs with Streamlit.

The app works through three main classes : Record, Block and Pychain.

#### Record
The Record class's scope is to store the data given by the user.

#### Block
The Block class's scope is to encode all the data to create a new hash.

#### Pychain
The Pychain class's scope is to create new blocks and check if the blockchain is valid or not.


The last part of the code generates an user interface via streamlit functions.
